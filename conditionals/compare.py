x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

# First menthoed:
# ===============
# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")

# if x > y:
#     print("x is greater than y")

# if x == y:
#     print("x is equal to y")


# Second method
# ============

# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")

# elif x > y:
#     print("x is greater than y")

# else:
#     print("x is equal to y")

# Third Method:
# ===========

# if x < y or x > y:
#     print("x is not equal to y")
# else:
#     print("x is equal to y")

# Forth Method:
# ========

if x != y:
    print("x is not equal to y")
else:
    print("x is not equal to y")
